## An 'Isolated' Development Environment using Vagrant

Automatically constructs an isolated development environment that automatically provisions software tools required for developing a software application.

This project samples a very respectable development environment with common software.

The benefits of an 'isolated' development environment is many:

1. No more of the classic __"Only works on my machine"__ problem  
2. Easily spin up a full dev environment just by one command, likewise to teardown  
3. The environment would be very similar/pretty-much identical to what it would be like in production  
4. Every developer in the software team/works on same project can develop using the same infrastructure
